# Contribution Guide

Hi and welcome to the contribution guide!  
Thanks for considering to contribute to the project.

## Found a Bug

If you have found a bug, great job!  
Please don't hesitate to create an Issue for it so it can be fixed.  
Please make sure to add the `bug` Label, and if appropriate, the `good first issue` Label.  
If you want to fix the bug yourself, then also assign the Issue to yourself and keep reading!

## Got a Suggestion

Suggestions to improve the project or codebase are very welcomed!  
Please first create an Issue with the idea.  
If it improves the site for visitors, assign it the `enhancement` tag, or if it is technical, then assign it the `technical` tag.  

## Issues

There are a bunch of [open issues](https://github.com/chase-manning/Haply/issues) that would be great if you could help with.  
Feel free to work on any issue that isn't already assigned to someone.  
Issues that are tagged with [good first issue](https://github.com/chase-manning/Haply/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) are the best place to start.

## Projects

The Issues are split up into seperate projects based on the area of the application they releate to.  
Make sure that when you create issues that you assign them to the right projects.  

## Anything Goes

Don't feel like you have to restrict yourself to the existing Issues.  
If you have any cool idea at all, please go for it!
