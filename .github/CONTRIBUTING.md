# Contribution Guide

Hi and welcome to the contribution guide!  
Thanks for considering to contribute to the project.

## Found a Bug

If you have found a bug, great job!  
Please don't hesitate to create an Issue for it so it can be fixed.  
Please make sure to add the `bug` Label, and if appropriate, the `good first issue` Label.  
If you want to fix the bug yourself, then also assign the Issue to yourself and keep reading!

## Got a Suggestion

Suggestions to improve the project or codebase are very welcomed!  
Please first create an Issue with the idea.  
If it improves the site for visitors, assign it the `enhancement` tag, or if it is technical, then assign it the `technical` tag.  
If the goal of the suggestion is to try increase visitor conversion, then we will need to validate it to prove that it increases conversion.  
Just be sure to add the `requires validation` tag, and I will take care of doing the validation once you have created a PR.

## Issues

There are a bunch of [open issues](https://github.com/chase-manning/Mood-Tracker/issues) that would be great if you could help with.  
Feel free to work on any issue that isn't already assigned to someone.  
Issues that are tagged with [good first issue](https://github.com/chase-manning/Mood-Tracker/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) are the best place to start.

## Projects

There one project which contains all the issues for the repo.  

### Personal Website
The issues in this project are ordered by their perceived priority and so this is a good place to see what to work on.  

## Development Workflow

If you are contributing, please create a branch off of Master.  
Make your changes in this branch until you are happy.  
And then create a PR back into Master.  
Please also link the Issue that the PR relates to, and include a screenshot of your changes if relevant

## Anything Goes

Don't feel like you have to restrict yourself to the existing Issues.  
If you have any cool idea at all, please go for it!
